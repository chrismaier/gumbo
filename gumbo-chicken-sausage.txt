# Instructions
Cook 3 lbs of Bacon - lightly cook on low heat, just need to extract the grease for now
Capture bacon grease in GLASS or METAL measuring container when hot
Bacon grease should be 1 1/2 cups - if not 1 1/2 cups of grease, add vegetable oil to make up difference 

Cut Bacon strips into 1/2" long pieces (*** keep separated from other meats ***)
Cut Chicken into ~1/2" cubes (must be small enough to cook in a stew)
Cut Sausage into ~1/8" thin slices (cut into crescents if desired)
Set meat aside in refrigerator 


# Cut vegetables 
Two bowls are needed.  One to contain all the finely minced items, the other to contain the diced vegetables.

Cut white onion in half
Finely mince one half of the white onion, dice the other
Finely mince 4 white onions, dice the other four
Finely mince 4 celery stalks, dice the other four
Finely mince ALL garlic
Finely mince one red tomato, dice the other tomato
Finely mince half of the bell peppers (either 1/2 or 1 1/2 depending on if okra is being used) and dice the other half of the bell pepper
If using okra, finely mince half of it, dice the other half.


# Measure dry ingredients
** Flower is NOT mixed / measured into this bowel

In a bowel, measure out the following and set aside (mixing is not required)
1 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoons coarse black pepper
1 teaspoon thyme
2 teaspoons sea salt
1 teaspoons cajun creole seasoning 
2 teaspoons ground cayenne pepper
1 teaspoons sriracha seasoning
2 teaspoons gumbo file powder 
4 bay leaves




# Make Roux
There needs to be 1 1/2 cups of oil - use vegetable oil to make up for "missing" bacon grease.  If you have 1 1/2 cups of bacon grease, you can skip the vegetable oil altogether, but the roux will be VERY rich.

In a sauce pan, mix the following:
3/4 - 1 1/2 cup Bacon grease
1/2 - 3/4 cup vegetable oil 
Total "oil" 1 1/2 cups (combination of bacon grease + any vegetable oil if not enough bacon grease)
2 cups flour

Mix continuously.  Cook on medium to low heat, mixing constantly until the roux is a dark brown. 
 
Take roux off of the heat, KEEP stirring.

Add in minced vegetables in large pot FIRST, then pour in roux and stir well.
Immediately add beef (or chicken) stock, beer, and tomato paste.

Stir the mix well

Bring mixture to a light boil, stir often, ensure mixture at bottom of the pot does not burn.

Lower heat as required

Stir in bacon, dry ingredients, and coarse vegetables, cover and simmer for 15 min, stir occasionally, ensure mixture at bottom of pot does not burn.

** Begin cooking rice

Add all remaining meat, stir and mix well, cover and simmer 15 more minutes, stir occasionally, ensure mixture at bottom of the pot does not burn.

Add
2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
1 tablespoons tabasco sauce

(add the ++ spicy ingredients now if they are desired)

Stir the mix well

Simmer 5-15 minutes or until chicken is fully cooked - pull out the largest chunks of chicken and cut / inspect / taste them to verify they have cooked through.

Leave gumbo on very low heat covered until rice is ready, then serve.
